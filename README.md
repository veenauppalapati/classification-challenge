# classification-challenge
This is my Module 13 challenge from bootcamp. In this challenge, we build and evaluate two machine learning classification models to determine which one is more accurate at detecting spam.


In this challenge, we evaluated two different Classifier model
- `Logistic Regression Model` : Uses sigmoid function to predict probabilities
- `Random Forest Classifier Model` :  uses multiple decision trees and makes a collective decision to predict probabilities or classifications.

## Steps Taken:

1. Prepared the Dataset
    - Collected and cleaned the data to ensure it was ready for analysis.

2. Split the Training and Testing Data
    - Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance effectively.

3. Scaled the Features
    - Applied feature scaling to standardize the data and improve model performance.

4. Evaluate the Logistic Regression Model
    - Created a Logistic Regression model.

    - Trained the model using the training dataset.

    - Evaluated the model’s performance on the training dataset.

    - Made predictions on the testing dataset.

    - Evaluated the model’s performance on the testing dataset.

    - Evaluate the Random Forest Classifier Model

5. Created a Random Forest Classifier model.
    - Trained the model using the training dataset.

    - Evaluated the model’s performance on the training dataset.
    
    - Made predictions on the testing dataset.
    
    - Evaluated the model’s performance on the testing dataset.
    
    - Selected the Best-Performing Model

6. Compared the performance of both models on the testing dataset.
    - Chose the model that demonstrated the best accuracy and generalization capabilities.
